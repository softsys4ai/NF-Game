V3 Notes:

The game is controlled by two competing inputs/events. One event takes a picture every 10 milliseconds (which can be controlled on line 111), and the other event takes input from mouse position.

Need to change the file path that game images are saved to (line 102)

Opponent's paddle randomly changes speed each time it changes direction. 

If one desires to play the game without image recording, comment out lines 225-240
