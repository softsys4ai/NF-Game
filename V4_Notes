V4 Notes

This game is controlled by one input event that goes off every 10ms. Each time, the game has a screenshot recorded, and the player's paddle position is updated as well. This would be the optimal way to incorporate mulitple actions/inputs, as events do not have to compete with each other.

Need to change the file path that game images are saved to (line 102).

To play the game without images being taken, comment out lines 220-221.
